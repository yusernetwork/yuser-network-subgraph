# Yuser Subgraph

The Yuser Subgraph initially forked from The Graph [example subgraph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph). 
Created by Yuser Inc. to index smart contract events and data on MoonbaseAlpha using the Graph.

## Setup

Install the node dependencies using `npm install`:

```shell
npm install
```

Create the TS types for The Graph (requires the `artifacts` folder created by contract compilation):

```shell
npm run codegen
```


> For more information see The Graph docs on https://thegraph.com/docs/.
